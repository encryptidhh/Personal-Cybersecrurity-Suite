## About this Repo
This is my **Personal Cybersecurity Suite**, a repository where I house some cybersecurity mini-projects that I'm working on:
- 🦾 A password strength checker that grades how strong passwords are and estimates how long they'd take to crack
  *(this is currently in development - the file is called [PasswordStrengthChecker.py](https://github.com/encryptidhh/Personal-Cybersecrurity-Suite/blob/b1cf7fc371f3b69e31dd9bb940c0d73e334e81a7/PasswordStrengthChecker.py))*
- 🗄️A password manager to store secure passwords
- 👣 A digital footprint tracker to remove data that hackers could use for initial reconnaissance
- 🎣 An anti-phishing email filter that flags suspicious links and attachments in emails.
- 🎮 A gamified phishing email quiz
- 🚫 A browser extension that detects and blocks suspicious websites (& scripts).
- 📃 A personal cybersecurity audit form
